# MIOK_Info_App
Emergency information app


We built an emergency response app for domestic abuse. The purpose of the app is to provide information to adults or caregivers
on what help they have available from the government and any helplines. It also has a quiz in the app to make it more interactive.

Our client was Fiona Te Momo from the University of Massey who is building this project as a side project.
